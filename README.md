   This will use VS Code and Node. After cloning this repo to your machine, open the folder in VS Code and open it in the terminal. You will then need to download the node modules by typing "npm i" and it should download all that you need. Then you will run the app by typing "node index.js" and then follow the prompts. After that your README file will be generated, and if there are any other additions you need to make, you can make them as normal in VS Code directly in the file.
